# Mission to Mars

## Overview of Project
Perform web scraping to extract online data that is stored in a *MongoDB* and displays the data with *Flask* on a local web browser and use *Bootstrap 3* to edit the visual aesthetics of the browser. 

### Purpose:
Using our knowledge of web scraping, Robin has asked us to build a script, that at a click of a button, pulls information from here requested website (see list of websites below). 
1. https://redplanetscience.com
2. https://spaceimages-mars.com
3. https://galaxyfacts-mars.com

## Results:
When ran, the program will generate theâ€¦
- Latest news article about the planet Mars (see image below)

- And lastly, provide four additional images of the Mars Hemispheres (run app.py to see additional images) 

## Summary:
Thanks to a little help from us, Robin can now gather information about the planet Mars with a click of a button and have it all displayed on one location without having to visit multiple websites and scroll through pages to determine the latest news and images. Having this ability to perform this task, makes Robin feel she is one step closer to her dream of working for NASA.
